# FLemit

FLemit is a library that allows dynamic ABC (ActionScript Byte Code) code to be generated and executed at runtime. FLemit is NOT an ActionScript compiler; it requires users have a thorough knowledge of the AVM2.

FLemit currently only exists as the basis for FLoxy, the dynamic proxy generation library which, in turn, was created for ASMock. For that reason, it's APIs are not currently documented and will change dramatically in the future.

# This Fork

Forked from [FLemit (Google Code)](http://code.google.com/p/flemit/) to support additional features required by [Mockolate](http://mockolate.org/) ([github](http://github.com/drewbourne/mockolate)).
